## Submitting Code
GitHub has a pretty strictly enforced branch/pull request flow if you wish to submit code. Currently there's no unit testing, or required standards of coding. Maybe one day.

## Dev Setup
Also fairly simple:
- Edit in whatever you like
- Make sure it compiles and runs in OpenSCAD
